MissingOutputException in rule plot_aggregated_results in file /Users/lavan/Desktop/Python/SIPLab/Snakemake_Example/Snakefile, line 118:
Job 11  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/aggregated_plot.png (missing locally, parent dir contents: aggregated_metrics.csv, config2, config3, config1)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
