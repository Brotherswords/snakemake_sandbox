MissingOutputException in rule train_model in file /Users/lavan/Desktop/Python Things hissssss/SIPLab/Snakemake_Example/Snakefile, line 2:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/model.h5 (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
results/model_output.txt (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
