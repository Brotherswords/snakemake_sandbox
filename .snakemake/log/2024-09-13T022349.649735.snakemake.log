MissingOutputException in rule train_model in file /Users/lavan/Desktop/Python/SIPLab/Snakemake_Example/Snakefile, line 6:
Job 3  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/model_output.txt (missing locally, parent dir contents: model_loss.csv, model_plot.png, model.h5, model_output.csv)
Removing output files of failed job train_model since they might be corrupted:
results/model.h5
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
